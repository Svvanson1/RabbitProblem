How many months until the Rabbits take over earth?

Rabbits are known for their fast breeding, but how soon will they dominate the earth?

Starting with a small population of male and female rabbits we have to figure out how long it will take for them to outnumber humans 2:1.

Every month a fertile female will have 14 offspring (5 males and 9 females).

A female rabbit is fertile when it has reached the age of 4 months, they never stop being fertile.

Rabbits die at the age of 8 years (96 months).
